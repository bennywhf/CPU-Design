Here are two implementations of simple CPU digital design that will run on DE2-115 FPGA board. In the CPU folder, the design allows users to shift 16 switches on the DE2-115 board and press a key to execute the entered instruction. In the Advance CPU, there is a ram module added that allows the cpu to fetch instructions and use a clock instead of user pressed button./
